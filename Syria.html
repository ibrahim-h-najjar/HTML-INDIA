            <li>Now in its 11th year, the Syrian refugee crisis remains the world’s largest refugee and displacement crisis of our time. Since the Syrian civil war officially began March 15, 2011, families have suffered under brutal conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people, torn the nation apart, and set back the standard of living by decades.</li>
            <li>About 6.8 million Syrians are refugees and asylum-seekers, and another 6.7 million people are displaced within Syria. This means 13.5 million Syrians in total are forcibly displaced, more than half of the country’s population. Nearly 11.1 million people in Syria need humanitarian assistance. And about half of the people affected by the Syrian refugee crisis are children.</li>

        <img src="images/Syria/economic.png" style="width: 50%;
        transform: translate(50%, 0px);">
        <p>The devastation to the Syrian economy from 10 years of violence cannot be underestimated. Targeted attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, including attacks on markets, hospitals, and schools in rural and urban areas, have led to estimates of more than 400,000 civilians killed and half of the pre-war population displaced internally or as refugees in the region of Europe. Destruction of essential infrastructure and loss of life coupled with years of economic negligence have left the Syrian economy in tatters. </p>

        <p> According to the World Bank, the Syrian economy has shrunk by more than 60 percent since 2010, and the Syrian pound has crashed. Pre-war, the Syrian pound traded near 50 SYP to the dollar. As of January 2021, it was formally trading at over 1,250 SYP and informally at over 3,000 SYP. This equates to a 300 percent inflation rate increase on consumer goods.</p>

        <h1 class="subtitle">Ancient Syria </h1>
        <img src="images/Syria/incientjpg.jpg" alt="palmyra" style="width: 100%;">

        <p>The oldest human remains found in Syria date back to roughly 700,000 years ago. Archeologists have uncovered skeletons and bones of Neanderthals that lived in the region during this period.</p>

        <p>Ebla, a city in Syria that’s thought to have existed around 3,000 B.C., is one of the oldest settlements to be excavated.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout ancient times, Syria was occupied and ruled by several empires, including the Egyptians, Hittites, Sumerians, Mitanni, Assyrians, Babylonians, Canaanites, Phoenicians, Arameans, Amorites, Persians, Greeks and Romans.</p>

        <p>Ancient Syria was a region referred to often in the Bible. In one well-known account, the apostle Paul cited the “road to Damascus”—the largest city in Syria—as the place where he had visions that led to his Christian conversion.</p>

        <p>When the Roman Empire fell, Syria became part of the Eastern or Byzantine Empire.</p>

        <p>In 637 A.D., Muslim armies defeated the Byzantine Empire and took control of Syria. The Islamic religion spread quickly throughout the region, and its different factions rose to power.</p>

        <p>Damascus eventually became the capital of the Islamic world, but was replaced by Baghdad in Iraq around 750 A.D. This change led to economic decline in Syria, and for the next several centuries, the region became unstable and was ruled by various groups.</p>

        <p>In 1516, the Ottoman Empire conquered Syria and remained in power until 1918. This was considered a relatively peaceful and stable period in Syria’s history.</p>

        <h1 class="subtitle">The Importance of Syrian Location</h1>
        <img src="images/Syria/syria_in_the_world.jpg" alt="map" style="width: auto">
        <p>The location of Syria holds significance not because of the country's resources, but of the countries located around it. The Middle East is the oil production giant of the world, and is a sensitive spot for intervention. The location of Syria brings out legitimate reasons to be wary of intervention, as the civil war must be contained at all costs. The addition of a foreign power may allow the war to spill over into neighboring countries, inciting a deadly Middle Eastern war that would be devastating.</p>
        <p>Not only is Syria close to the Middle Eastern oil titans, but the continent of Africa lays not far away. Africa is one of the most vulnerable places on earth, one rocked by poverty, hunger, and disease. The feeble economies of the poverty-stricken Africa could not take the outcome of a war spilling into its borders. Containing the war to the country of Syria is a precaution that must be taken carefully. If the conflict somehow spreads to Africa, the continent and its emerging countries will face the fallout of a war they had no stake in.</p>

        <h1 class="subtitle">Tourism</h1>
        <p>Tourism in Syria has greatly reduced as a result of the Syrian War, that began in 2011 and is ongoing, and its associated refugee crisis. Tourism has been further impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 starting in March 2020. The international economic sanctions imposed on Syria and the sharp drop in the value of the Syrian pound (SYP) also adversely impact tourism in Syria. The Ministry of Tourism is the responsible government department.</p>
        <p>Before the start of the Syrian Civil War, 8.5 million tourists visited Syria in 2010, who brought in tourist revenue estimated at 30.8 billion SYP (US$8.4 billion, at 2010 rates), and accounted for 14% of the country's economy. By 2015, the number of tourists had declined by more than 98%.</p>
        <p>Many tourist attractions have been damaged or destroyed by shelling, flights by all major airlines have been suspended, and many major tourist hotels have closed. It is estimated that considerable investment will be necessary to revive Syria's tourism industry.</p>

        <p>Syrian cuisine is a diffusion of the cultures of civilizations that settled in Syria, particularly during and after the Islamic era beginning with the Arab Umayyad conquest, then the eventual Persian-influenced Abbasids and ending with the strong influences of Turkish cuisine, resulting from the coming of the Ottoman Turks. It is in many ways similar to other (Greater Syria) Levantine cuisines, mainly Lebanese, Palestinian, Jordanian and Iraqi.</p>

            <p>Damascus steel was the forged steel of the blades of swords smithed in the Near East from ingots of Wootz steel either imported from Southern India or made in production centres in Sri Lanka, or Khorasan, Iran. These swords are characterized by distinctive patterns of banding and mottling reminiscent of flowing water, sometimes in a "ladder" or "rose" pattern. Such blades were reputed to be tough, resistant to shattering, and capable of being honed to a sharp, resilient edge.</p>
